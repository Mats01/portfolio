# Developer Journal: Making the Dayty App

The app will live here: [dayty.farmoredifferent.com](http://dayty.farmoredifferent.com) once it’s completed. For now this just redirects to my development server through [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  


## What is Dayty?

I am making this app primarily because I couldn't find a good app to be a digital companion for my analog (paper) journal. At the end of each day, I try to grade myself on how well I did in important areas of my life. This is an idea found in many journal concepts like **gratitude journals,** or on the Cortex podcast as a part of their **Theme System**.
For me, themes are broad areas of life that are likely to make me happier and more fulfilled if I put work into them. But Dayty isn't designed to keep you locked into one system. You can decide what system is best for you. The questions you ask yourself at the end of each day could be as simple as "Have I worked out today?", or "Have I gone the whole day without a cigarette?" to more challenging ones like "Have I been a good person?".
The grading system is flexible too, where you can choose the scale you can rate yourself on. I recommend 0 to 2 as it forces you to think hard about how much effort you put in and be real with yourself, but the app will let you go up to 10!

## A simple guide

I've decided to compile a simple guide here at the beginning which I'll update as the app evolves.
So let's dive in.

To begin with, you need to sign up to start using the app. Once you create an account you are greeted with a screen with some recommended themes and empty spaces to write your questions. Here you can edit them, archive them, or add more. When you're all set up, you can head on over to Home to input your first entry.

*Additionally, in this first step you can visit the Setting screen to change the range you will be grading yourself on.*

On the Home screen you can grade yourself each day, and those grades will show up in your history (in your Week tab).

The app also now supports dark mode, automatically adjusting to your system’s preferences.
